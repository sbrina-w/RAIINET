## stop here
## player 1's firewall shows up as m

# move E left
## firewall reveals data that passes through data E is revealed

# move d down
## d is V2, E is D1, firewall does not affect the owner, therefore battle takes place. 
## V2 > D1, d wins. P1 downloads E. (1D)

# move D up
# move e down

# move D up
## D is V4, d is v2. In a battle, D would win. 
## Firewall takes priority over battle, D is downloaded by the owner (P2). P2 has 1V.

# move d down
# move F up
# move e down
# move F up

# move e left
## e is not revealed since a player's own firewall does not affect their links
## show text display link shown instead of firewall when link is on firewall.
